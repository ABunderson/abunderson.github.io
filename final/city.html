      <div class="history">
        <h2>The Start</h2>
        <p>Highland, Utah has an orgin myth about its name. It is rumored that Highland was named by Scottish imigrants because it reminded them of the Scottish Highlands of their beloved mother country. The validity of this story has never been proven, but the scenery of the two places is not quite close enough to make them comparison stick. Highland was a very small town in the beginning. There were only 88 living here recorded on the 1880 census. Most of those people were early members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.</p>
        <p>Highland was not officially recognized as a city until the census of 1900. At that time the population had increased from 88 to 195 residents. The size of Highland has changed since it was first designated as such. In the beginning, it contained 4840 acres. Now, it includes 5530 acres. This is an increase of 14%. </p>

        <h2>The Future</h2>
        <p>There is a very exciting new park in development at the moment. The Dry Creek Debris Basin is currently being turned into a reservoir. This new lake will be lots of fun for all members of the family. There will be a convinent place to go swimmming, fishing, and kayaking. It is also close to the Murcock Canal Trial for those who do not like getting their feet wet. The project is expected to be finished in the spring of 2022 (fingers crossed that there are no more delays). Get excited for this beautiful new lake!</p>
