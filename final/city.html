        <p>
          Highland, Utah has an origin myth about its name. It is rumored that
          Highland was named by Scottish immigrants because it reminded them of
          the Scottish Highlands of their beloved mother country. The validity
          of this story has never been proven, but the scenery of the two places
          is not quite close enough to make them comparison stick. Highland was
          a very small town in the beginning. There were only 88 living here
          recorded on the 1880 census. Most of those people were early members
          of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.
        </p>
        <p>
          Highland was not officially recognized as a city until the census of
          1900. At that time, the population had increased from 88 to 195
          residents. The size of Highland has changed since it was first
          designated as such. In the beginning, it contained 4840 acres. Now, it
          includes 5530 acres. This is an increase of 14%.

        <h2>Where we are now</h2>
        <p>
          Highland is a thriving city that is neither too big nor too small. It
          is in fact just the right size. The population of Highland is 19,175.
          It is a great place to live! It is not crowded and crime-ridden like
          large cities, but close enough to other bigger cities to have all the
          amenities one could want in life. The population density is 2,221
          people per square mile. The average income is $176,079 and the median
          age is 24. There are new houses and neighborhoods just waiting to be
          filled with happy families and a lot of access to parks. The local
          library has kid friendly activities all the time. It is a place where
          local businesses thrive.

        <h2>The Future</h2>
        <p>
          There is a very exciting new park in development right now. The Dry
          Creek Debris Basin is currently being turned into a reservoir. This
          new lake will be lots of fun for all members of the family. There will
          be a convenient place to go swimming, fishing, and kayaking. It is
          also close to the Murdock Canal Trial for those who do not like
          getting their feet wet. The project is expected to be finished in the
          spring of 2022 (fingers crossed that there are no more delays!) Get
          excited for this beautiful new lake!
